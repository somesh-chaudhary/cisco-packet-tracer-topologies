Cisco Packet Tracer ‚Äì Network Topologies

üìå Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of four fundamental network topologies using Cisco Packet Tracer: Mesh, Star, Bus, and Ring. Each topology is simulated in a separate .pkt file to help visualize how devices communicate, how data flows, and how faults impact a network.

Cisco Packet Tracer is a widely used simulation tool that allows students, educators, and networking enthusiasts to design, configure, and test networks without needing physical hardware. This project is a hands-on reference for understanding both the theory and practical behavior of physical topologies.

üåê Topologies Implemented

Mesh Topology

Every device connects to every other device.

Offers maximum redundancy and fault tolerance.

High cabling cost and complexity.

Star Topology

Devices connect to a central hub or switch.

Easy to install, configure, and troubleshoot.

Failure of the central hub affects the whole network.

Bus Topology

All devices share a single backbone cable.

Simple and requires less cabling.

A fault in the backbone can bring down the entire network.

Ring Topology

Devices form a closed loop where data travels in one direction.

Easy fault detection and simple structure.

Breaks in the ring disrupt communication (unless dual rings are used).

‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Requirements

Cisco Packet Tracer (v7.x or higher recommended)

Basic understanding of IP addressing, cabling, and device configuration

üöÄ How to Use

Install Cisco Packet Tracer.

Open any .pkt file from this repository.

Assign IP addresses to devices (if not pre-configured).

Test connectivity using Ping or simulation mode.

Modify the topology to experiment with different setups.

üìñ Learning Outcomes

Understand the structure and function of four major network topologies.

Practice building and testing networks in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Compare the pros and cons of each topology for real-world applications.
